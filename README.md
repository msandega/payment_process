   ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
5. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
6. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/payments`.
7. Swagger documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/`.

### Running Tests

   - Start Command: `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
4. Set auto-deploy to off. Take note of the service ID and Render key in deploy hook provided.
5. In the GitHub repository, add the following secrets to enable automatic deployment:
   - `RENDER_SERVICE_ID`: Your Render service ID.
